# **Digital** \
**Activism**

\ 

> the space is virtual \
> the consequences are real

<!-- - 2 types of digital activism: talking and doing

- the space might be virtual, but the consequences are real:

- many people who actually DID something are on the run, in jail, or dead :(
  - peter sunde/anakata (TPB) - jail
  - assange - uk/us limbo
  - swartz  - suicide
  - manning - us gulag
  - snowden - exile
  - quest com CEO - (came out of jail now, after 4.5y) - 
      https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/384846839453089793

- (none of them were prosecuted using the LAW!)

- only way to do something AND live free, is to be virtual yourself
  - satoshi nakamoto - BTC
  - dread pirate roberts - SR

## **#TPB**
 
![](http://retardriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/tpb-logo.jpg)


## **MOTIVATION**

> "Today the development often moves faster in technology than in the cultural realm. \
> But neither language barriers nor **the copyright industry's war on technology** should impede people from partaking in new technologies and cultures" \

— **anakata**, 2005-02-06, [TPB blog](http://thepiratebay.se/blog/3)

## **ACTION**

> "The Pirate Bay (commonly abbreviated TPB) is a **website** that provides **torrent files** and magnet links to facilitate **peer-to-peer file sharing** using the BitTorrent protocol. It was founded in Sweden in **2003**."

- [wiki/The_Pirate_Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay)

## **IMPACT**

- largest source for illegal media
- largest torrent index
- ex-largest torrent tracker
    - <small>(TPB has no tracker nowadays, the [`CCC` has](http://opentracker.blog.h3q.com/2011/03/04/recent-fuzz-about-the-tracker/))</small>

## **REACTION**

- 2008: trial against TPB in sweden (copyright infringement)
- movie: "TPB: AFK" <http://watch.tpbafk.tv>

##

> "On 17 **April 2009**, Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm and Carl Lundström were found guilty of **assistance to copyright infringement** and sentenced to **one year in prison** and **payment of a fine** of 30 million SEK (app. 4,200,000 USD; 2,800,000 GBP; or **3,100,000 EUR**), after a trial of nine days."

- <small>[wiki/The_Pirate_Bay#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay#History)</small>


## `anakata` 

> "On 27 November 2013 he was **extradited to Denmark**, where he was **charged with infiltrating the Danish social security database**, driver’s license database, and the shared IT system used in the Schengen zone. He is **currently being held in solitary confinement**, and is facing up to 6 years in prison in Denmark if he is found guilty."

- ([Gottfrid Svartholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfrid_Svartholm))

## **aaron swartz**

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Aaron_Swartz_profile.jpg)

##

> "an American **computer programmer, writer, political organizer and Internet activist**. Swartz was involved in the development of the **web feed format RSS**, the organization **Creative Commons**, the website framework web.py and the social news site, **Reddit**."

- [wiki/Aaron_Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz)


## **MOTIVATION**

> "The system is changing. **Thanks to the Internet, everyday people can learn about and organize around an issue even if the system is determined to ignore it.** Now, maybe we won't win every time -- this is real life, after all -- but we finally have a chance. **But it only works if you take part.**"

<small>
  
- [Afterword by Aaron Swartz, in: "Homeland" by Cory Doctorow (2013)](http://craphound.com/homeland/Cory_Doctorow_-_Homeland.html#h_10)

</small>

## **ACTION**

- [CreativeCommons](http://creativecommons.org)
- Open Data
    - `PACER` data
    - `JSTOR` data
- also: 
    - wikileaks supporter
    - [DeadDrop](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/05/introducing-strongbox-anonymous-document-sharing-tool.html)

## OpenLibrary

> "Around **2006**, Swartz acquired the **Library of Congress's complete bibliographic dataset**: the library charged fees to access this, but as a government document, it was not copyright-protected within the USA. \
> By **posting the data on OpenLibrary, Swartz made it freely available**. \
> The Library of Congress project was met with **approval by the Copyright Office**."

## `PACER`

> "In **2008**, Swartz downloaded and **released about 2.7 million federal court documents** stored in the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (**PACER**) database managed by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts."

## `PACER`

<small>
  
![Steve Schultze's version of the Perl script Swartz used to liberate 2.7 million documents from PACER. © Steve Schultze](images/swartz-code-pacerget2.png)

</small>

## `PACER`

- used account of sacramento library \
  ($1.5M bill)
- FBI investigated, \
  but **"found nothing wrong"** <small>[(source)](https://public.resource.org/aaron/army/index.html)</small>

## `JSTOR`

> "Swartz used **JSTOR**, a digital repository, to **download a large number of academic journal articles** through MIT's computer network over the course of a few weeks **in late 2010 and early 2011**. At the time, Swartz was a research fellow at Harvard University, which provided him with a JSTOR account."

## **IMPACT**

> "**This was part of how Aaron approached things**. [… His PACER activities were] a project to liberate the documents but **also an effort to make public the problems that existed to hopefully solve the larger policy problem**."

- [ars technica, 2013-02](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/02/the-inside-story-of-aaron-swartzs-campaign-to-liberate-court-filings/)


## **REACTION**

> "On January 6, 2011, Swartz was **arrested by MIT police** on state breaking-and-entering charges, **after systematically downloading academic journal articles from JSTOR**. Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and 11 violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative **maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison**, asset forfeiture, restitution and supervised release."

## 

> "Two years later, two days after the prosecution denied his lawyer's second offer of a plea bargain, **Swartz was found dead** in his Brooklyn, New York apartment, where he had hanged himself."

- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz)

## **julian assange**

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Julian_Assange_cropped_%28Norway%2C_March_2010%29.jpg)

## **MOTIVATION**

> "The more **secretive or unjust an organization** is, the **more leaks induce fear and paranoia in its leadership** and planning coterie.  \
> This must result in minimization of efficient internal communications mechanisms (an increase in **cognitive 'secrecy tax'**) and consequent system-wide cognitive decline resulting in decreased ability to hold onto power as the environment demands adaption."

##

> "Hence **in a world where leaking is easy**, secretive or **unjust systems are nonlinearly hit relative to open, just systems**. \
> Since unjust systems, by their nature induce opponents, and in many places barely have the upper hand, mass leaking leaves them exquisitely vulnerable to those who seek to replace them with more open forms of governance."

> \
> ***Tunisia***: The cables have been credited with directly influencing what came to be known as the **Jasmine Revolution** […]”
