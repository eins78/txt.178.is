# transcription software

conclusion: 

- there are a bunch of programs **assisting with the manual typing** — they can have slower playback, a button to go back X seconds and so on. so they are more or less like quicktime, VLC, or any other media player, but are specialised for these needs (as opposed to watching movies etc)

- there seems to be only 1 program that does what we want: a) do an automatic run from a recording and then having an interface for fixing that (see `Dragon`).
