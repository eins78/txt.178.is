# What is Bitcoin

- *From the perspective Satoshi Nakamoto and what problems he tried to solve*

# we want digital "money", with full control of ownership

# money == way to transfer abstracted value for goods and services

# just digital money is bad because you can copy it

# to keep people from copying money and spending it twice we need a central bank

# We dont want a central bank because its central

# Because we can not trust people we still want a central bank

# We build a piece of software which connects every user into one system, forming a decentral bank

# Also, there is no money -- just accounts and their positive or zero balance

# The system keeps a log of all transactions between accounts, split into blocks with all the transactions of average 10 minutes

# Every users computer uses his computing power to make and verify these blocks

# The system uses cryptography to make it mathematically harder than it would be to keep the log

# If you would want to cheat, you would make your own blocks claiming a lot of transactions to you -- needs more than half of the computing power of the combined net

# "Network effect" -- bla -- Mining!
